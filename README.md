# Tic Tac Toe game

This project is a simple Tic Tac Toe game built with JavaScript using React.
It was created as a practice project to understand the basics of React, including component structure, props, and state management.

The game allows two players to:

- Take turns placing X and O on a 3Ã—3 grid
- Detect when a player wins or when the game ends in a draw
- Reset the board to play again

The main goal of the project was to practice building interactive UIs with React and implement basic game logic using state.
